            <h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:verdana; font-size:35px;">The Palace by Kaveh Akbar</h1>
            
            <pre>
            
            It’s hard to remember who I’m talking to
            
            and why. The palace burns, the palace
            
            is fire
            
            and my throne is comfy and
            
            square.


            Remember: the old king invited his subjects into his home

            to feast on stores of apple tarts and sweet lamb. To feast on sweet lamb of stories. He believed

            they loved him, that his goodness

            had earned him their goodness.

            Their goodness dragged him into the street

            and tore off

            his arms, plucked

                his goodness out, plucked his fingers out

                    like feathers.


            There are no good kings.

            Only beautiful palaces.
            
            
            Who here could claim to be merely guilty?
               
                The mere.
              
                My life
           
            growing monstrous
           
            with ease.
           
            To be an American my father left his siblings
               
                 believing
           
            he’d never see them again. My father
              
                    wanted to be Mick Jagger. My father
              
                went full ghost,
           
            ended up working on duck farms for thirty years, once a sleep
             
                a couch,
               
                he coughed up a feather.

            America could be a metaphor, but it isn’t.
            
            Asleep on the couch, he coughed up a white duck feather.    
            
            
            There are no doors in America.

            Only king-sized holes.</pre>


            To be an American is to be a scholar
           
            of opportunity.
           
            Opportunity costs.
            
            Every orange I eat disappears the million
           
            peaches, plums, pears I could have eaten
           
            but didn’t.
           
            In heaven, opportunity costs.
           
            In her heaven
           
            my mother grows
           
            peaches, plums, pears, and I eat them till I pass out
           
            and wake up in heaven;
          
            wake up, and eat some more. I couldn’t dream of doing anything
           
            by halves. Whatever it is, I’ll take the whole
           
                bouquet. Please and soon.


        Are you still listening?
          
            Every person I touch
           
                costs me ten million I’ll never meet. Persons and persons,
           
            inside each
           
            a palace on fire. Inside each
      
        Mick Jagger wearing a gorilla-pelt coat covered in ostrich feathers.
      
        He calls it “glamouflage.”  


        What’s gone, but still seen?


        Luckless soldiers,
        
        the pencil pushed slowly through my brother’s tricep.
       
        (What’s gone, but still seen?)
       
        He didn’t scream, just let his eyes water.
      
        If I smile even a little: they start sharpening their swords.
      
        And they’re right. This is no time for joy.
      
        This is no time. The palace burns.
       
        Pencil pushes slowly through my brother’s brother.
       
        (What’s still, but seen gone?)


        A king governs best
      
        in the dark, where you can’t see his hands move. A king
      
        doesn’t see us
      
        watching the king.
      
        We sew God’s initials into our workshirts
       
        while our babies get thinner.
       
        The babies do not see us
      
        watching our babies
       
        get thinner.
       
        Our babies born addicted to fear of babies.
       
        Our babies gumming apples in the sun.


        America? the broken headstone.

        America? far enough away from itself.


        Hello, this is Kaveh speaking:
        
        I wanted to be Keats
        
        (but I’ve already lived four years too long).
        
        Hello, this is Keats speaking:
        
        it is absurd to say anything now
        
        (much less anything new).
        
        Hello, this is no one speaking:
        
        hibiscus bloom, wet feathers,
        
        (a tiny thumb of ash).


        To be American is to be a hunter.
        
        To be American. Who can be American?
        
        To be American is to be? What? A hunter? A hunter
        
        who shoots only money.
        
                No, not money—
        
                money.

        
        I have a kitchen device
      
        that lets me spin lettuce.
      
        There is no elegant way
      
            to say this—people
      
            with living hearts
      
            that could fit in my chest
      
        want to melt the city where I was born.
      
        At his elementary school in an American suburb,
      
        a boy’s shirt says: “We Did It To Hiroshima, We Can Do It To Tehran!”


        At his elementary school in an American suburb,
        
        a boy’s shirt says: “We Did It To Hiroshima, We Can Do It To Tehran!”


        The take-home trophy:

            roasted goat baying on the spit.


        A boy’s shirt says: “We Did It To Hiroshima, We Can Do It To Tehran!”
      
        He is asked to turn his shirt inside out.
      
        He is asked? His insides, out.
      
        After he complies, his parents sue the school district.
      
        Our souls want to know
      
        how they were made,
      
                what is owed.
      
        These parents want their boy
      
        to want to melt my family,
      
        and I live among them.
      
        Palace throne. Comfy, burning.
      
        I draw it without lifting my pen.
      
        I draw it fat as creation—
      
                empty as a footprint.



        How to live? reading poems, breathing shallow,

        spinning lettuce.


        America the shallow breath,

        how to live?

        The shallow trap, America

        catching

        only what is too small to eat.


        The dead keep warm under America

        while my mother fries eggplant on a stove.


        I am not there.
        
        I am elsewhere in America (I am always
        
        elsewhere in America) writing this, writing this, writing this, English
        
        is my mother’s first language,
        
        but not mine.
        
        I might have said bademjan.
        
        I might have said khodafez.
            
            
            Sizzling oil, great fists of smoke, writing this.


        The first insect drawn by man was a locust.
        
        Art is where what we survive survives.
        
        Sizzling oil, great fists of smoke. Art. Sizzling oil. Art.
       
        My mother fries eggplant. The first
        
        insect drawn by man survives.


        Who to kiss the prom queen?
         
            Brain pulsing like an oyster.
        
        Who to win the war?
        
        America rises
        
                covered in
        
        the tiny grains of its own making:
        
        fresh bread pocked with flour dust.
        
        Mistyping in an e-mail I write,
        
        I lose you so much today,
        
        then leave it.
        
        Forbidden mercies, windmills spinning around
        
        like drunk teenagers.


        Any document of civilization is also a document of barbarism
         
            says the palace, burning.
         
            I, a man
         
            am what I do not say.
        
        America I warn you if you invite me into your home
        
        I will linger,
        
        losing, kissing my beloveds frankly,
        
            pulling up radishes
        
            and capping all your pens.
        
        There are no good kings,
        
        only burning palaces.
        
        Lose me today, so much.
