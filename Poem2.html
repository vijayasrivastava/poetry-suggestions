            I look at my father
            
            though a harsh man, 
           
            I wonder what he would have been like when he was my age.
            
            I think, 
           
            crude 
           
            unromantic 
           
            a manly man
           
            you know the ones who are not in touch with their feminine side.
           
            But once I found a love poem 
           
            handwritten in one of  his old books from medical school.
           
            it talked about a man's wish to walk with his lover, 
           
            hand in hand 
           
            outside in the rain. 
           
            It is hard to imagine my father in love. 
           
            Maybe he loved that woman in the poem so much,
           
            he used up all his love?
