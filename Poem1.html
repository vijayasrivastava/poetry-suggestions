            <pre>
            don’t ever get the idea I am a poet; you can see me <br>
            at the racetrack any day half drunk <br>
            betting quarters, sidewheelers and straight thoroughs, <br>
            but let me tell you, there are some women there<br>
            who go where the money goes, and sometimes when you<br>
            look at these whores these onehundreddollar whores<br>
            you wonder sometimes if nature isn’t playing a joke<br>
            dealing out so much breast and ass and the way<br>
            it’s all hung together, you look and you look and<br>
            you look and you can’t believe it; there are ordinary women<br>
            and then there is something else that wants to make you<br>
            tear up paintings and break albums of Beethoven<br>
            across the back of the john; anyhow, the season<br>
            was dragging and the big boys were getting busted,<br>
            all the non-pros, the producers, the cameraman,<br>
            the pushers of Mary, the fur salesman, the owners<br>
            themselves, and Saint Louie was running this day:<br>
            a sidewheeler that broke when he got in close;<br>
            he ran with his head down and was mean and ugly<br>
            and 35 to 1, and I put a ten down on him.<br>
            the driver broke him wide<br>
            took him out by the fence where he’d be alone<br>
            even if he had to travel four times as far,<br>
            and that’s the way he went it<br>
            all the way by the outer fence<br>
            traveling two miles in one<br>
            and he won like he was mad as hell<br>
            and he wasn’t even tired,<br>
            and the biggest blonde of all<br>
            all ass and breast, hardly anything else<br>
            went to the payoff window with me.<br>
            <br>
            that night I couldn’t destroy her<br>
            although the springs shot sparks<br>
            and they pounded on the walls.<br>
            later she sat there in her slip<br>
            drinking Old Grandad<br>
            and she said<br>
            what’s a guy like you doing<br>
            living in a dump like this?<br>
            and I said<br>
            I’m a poet<br>
            <br>
            and she threw back her beautiful head and laughed.<br>
            <br>
            you? you . . . a poet?<br>
            <br>
            I guess you’re right, I said, I guess you’re right.<br>
            <br>
            but still she looked good to me, she still looked good,<br>
            and all thanks to an ugly horse<br>
            who wrote this poem.<br>
