            A man will climb onto your school bus 
            
            and insist your sisters name you enemy.  
            
            When you do not hide, he will point his gun 
            
            and fire three times. Three years later,  
            
            in an ocean of survival, and no apologies, 
            
            you will stand before the leaders 
           
            of the world and tell them 
            
            how your country is burning.
