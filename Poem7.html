            my parents are two long calls

            one is about the weather-always about the

            weather; father
            
            one is about everything-you should do <em>this</em>

            <em>this</em> and <em>that</em>; mother
            
            cities away i do not calculate distance but

            duration

            <em>has it been days?</em>
            
            <em>has it been hours? since you last called</em>
            
            you do not get out of a broken family because
            
            it gets out of you; a family in pieces
            
            where their name become a hello and my name
            
            becomes a good-bye
            
            two voices on each side of the phone is what i
            
            have in my legacy now
